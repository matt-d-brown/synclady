Clone/Download this Repo\r\n2. Run `python setup.py install`\r\n3. Copy the [default YAML file](#yaml-config) to `~` (users home directory).\r\n\r\n### Running Synclady\r\nFrom Terminal, run\r\n```synclady sync```\r\n\r\nThis will start a file listener on the local source directory and push changes to\r\nthe server source directory.\r\n\r\n### Functions\r\n* `synclady sync`: Watches over local path defined in source in [YAML configuration file](#yaml-config)\r\n* `synclady pull`: Replaces local directory with server contents (use only once\r\n  when you starting the application for the first time)\r\n* `synclady resync`: Pushes all changes which were made when local system was\r\n  offline and pulls new server contents\r\n\r\n### YAML configuration\r\nThis YAML is automatically created in the `~` (users home directory) directory.\r\nIt holds all the configuration attributes for Synclady.\r\n\r\n#### Attributes\r\n* `source`: Local path to be watched, and server path to be synced with\r\n* `endpoints`: Hash of each file/folder action which should ping to an API endpoint\r\n\r\n#### Default File\r\n```\r\n  source:\r\n    local: /Users/username/data/\r\n    server: /uploads/username/\r\n    ip: sample@192.168.1.1\r\n  endpoints:\r\n    file_create: \"http://192.168.1.1/api/files/create\"\r\n    file_destroy: \"http://192.168.1.1/api/files/destroy\"\r\n    folder_destroy: \"http://192.168.1.1/api/folders/destroy\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\nAll Synclady logs are maintained at `/tmp/synclady.log`\r\n\r\n### Coming up\r\n1.
